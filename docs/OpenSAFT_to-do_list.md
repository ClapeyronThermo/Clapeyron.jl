# OpenSAFT to-do list

The current plans of OpenSAFT are 

* Support for group contribution (GC) models like SAFT-Î³ Mie.
* Support for other ideal terms (Reid, Joback, etc).
* Support for mixture calculations, first using Ratchford-Rice, and eventually HELD.
* Implement framework for physical units.
* Support for electrolyte methods (SAFT-VRE Mie).
* Code optimisation by introducing more macros, and changing all string keys to more efficient symbols.
