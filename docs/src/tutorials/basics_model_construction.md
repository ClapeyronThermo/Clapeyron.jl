# Getting Started - Model Construction
All functions in Clapeyron revolve around an object we refer to as the `model`. These models are intended to hold all of the information required to model a given system within a specific equation of state. The absolute simplest of these is the `BasicIdeal` model, which models species as an ideal gas with only translational modes of motion. It can be constructed simply using:
```julia
julia> model = BasicIdeal(["water"])
BasicIdeal()
```
This `model` is unique as it is the only model object that does not hold any information as the ideal gas is a universal model that does not depend on the chemical identity of the species. Nevertheless, one can use this model to obtain properties such as the volume and isobaric heat capacity at a given temperature and pressure:
```julia
julia> volume(model,1e5,298.15)
0.02478957029602388

julia> isobaric_heat_capacity(model,1e5,298.15)
20.786156545383097
```
At this stage, we point out that all values within Clapeyron are in SI units, unless otherwise specified.

From here, we will now consider how `model`s are constructed in different equations of state and how users can implement their own parameters.

## Generic Models
Although `BasicIdeal` does provide the universal definition for the ideal gas model, it does fall short in one aspect: accounting for modes of motion beyond translation, such as rotations and vibrations. Accounting for these contributions does involve providing chemical-specific parameters. Thankfully, Clapeyron has a built-in databank of parameters for all supported equations of state. As an example, we consider carbon-dioxide modelled by the `ReidIdeal` model, as opposed to the basic ideal model:
```julia
julia> model1 = BasicIdeal(["carbon dioxide"])
BasicIdeal()

julia> model2 = ReidIdeal(["carbon dioxide"])
ReidIdeal with 1 component:
 "carbon dioxide"
Contains parameters: coeffs
```
The difference between these models is best observed when one considers the isobaric heat capacity:
```julia
julia> isobaric_heat_capacity(model1,1e5,298.15)
20.786156545383097

julia> isobaric_heat_capacity(model2,1e5,298.15)
37.16203981139605
```
The difference in values can be attributed to the missing rotational and vibration contributions. This difference is important to bear in mind when considering similar properties in other equations of state.

Nevertheless, due to the need for species-specific parameters, this `model2` contains much more information than for the `BasicIdeal` model:
* Component names:
```julia
julia> model2.components
1-element Vector{String}:
 "carbon dioxide"
```
* References for the equation of state:
```julia
julia> model2.references
"10.1063/1.3060771"
```
* The species-specific parameters:
```julia
julia> model2.params
Clapeyron.ReidIdealParam for ["carbon dioxide"] with 1 param:
 coeffs::SingleParam{NTuple{4, Float64}}

julia> model2.params.coeffs
SingleParam{NTuple{4, Float64}}("Reid Coefficients") with 1 component:
 "carbon dioxide" => (19.8, 0.0734, -5.6e-5, 1.72e-8)
```
One can also create a model for mixtures in a similar fashion:
```julia
julia> model3 = ReidIdeal(["carbon dioxide","methane"])
ReidIdeal with 2 components:
 "carbon dioxide"
 "methane"
Contains parameters: coeffs

julia> model3.params.coeffs
SingleParam{NTuple{4, Float64}}("Reid Coefficients") with 2 components:
 "carbon dioxide" => (19.8, 0.0734, -5.6e-5, 1.72e-8)
 "methane" => (19.25, 0.0521, 1.2e-5, -1.13e-8)
```
Ideal gas models are by far the simplest case to consider when building models. Other equations of state have additional features which will be discussed next. Of interest to general users may be the [group-contribution models](#group-contribution-models) and how to construct models [from user-defined parameters](#user-defined-parameters).

## Cubic Models
At the surface, cubic models are quite simple as well. As an example, consider a mixture of methanol and benzene in Peng-Robinson (`PR`):
```julia
julia> model = PR(["methanol","benzene"])
PR{BasicIdeal, PRAlpha, NoTranslation, vdW1fRule} with 2 components:
 "methanol"
 "benzene"
Contains parameters: a, b, Tc, Pc, Mw

julia> model.components
2-element Vector{String}:
 "methanol"
 "benzene"

julia> model.references
1-element Vector{String}:
 "10.1021/I160057A011"

julia> model.params.a
2Ã—2 PairParam{Float64}(["methanol", "benzene"]) with values:
 1.02049  1.4453
 1.4453   2.04695
```
Note that, as we are dealing with a mixture, we need to include binary parameters (parameters that depend on two species). This is stored as shown in the case of `a`. 

Cubics are unique due to their modular nature (we can swap out pieces of the equation to hopefully make a more-accurate model). This includes:
* **Alpha functions**, which improve the prediction the pure-component saturation curves:
```julia
julia> model = PR(["methanol","benzene"];alpha=TwuAlpha)
PR{BasicIdeal, TwuAlpha, NoTranslation, vdW1fRule} with 2 components:
 "methanol"
 "benzene"
Contains parameters: a, b, Tc, Pc, Mw

julia> model.alpha
TwuAlpha with 2 components:
 "methanol"
 "benzene"
Contains parameters: M, N, L
```
* **Volume translation methods**, which improve the prediction of the liquid volume:
```julia
julia> model = PR(["methanol","benzene"];translation=PenelouxTranslation)
PR{BasicIdeal, PRAlpha, PenelouxTranslation, vdW1fRule} with 2 components:
 "methanol"
 "benzene"
Contains parameters: a, b, Tc, Pc, Mw

julia> model.translation
PenelouxTranslation with 2 components:
 "methanol"
 "benzene"
Contains parameters: Vc, v_shift
```
* **Mixing rules**, which can improve the predicted phase behaviour. These come in two flavours:
    * Generic one-fluid mixing rules such as the van-der Waals one-fluid mixing rule (the default in all cubics):
    ```julia
    julia> model = PR(["methanol","benzene"])
    PR{BasicIdeal, PRAlpha, NoTranslation, vdW1fRule} with 2 components:
    "methanol"
    "benzene"
    Contains parameters: a, b, Tc, Pc, Mw

    julia> model.mixing
    vdW1fRule()
    ```
    * $G_E$-mixing rules where an activity coefficient model is used in conjunction with the cubic equation of state:
    ```julia
    julia> model = PR(["methanol","benzene"];mixing=HVRule,activity=UNIFAC)
    PR{BasicIdeal, PRAlpha, NoTranslation, HVRule{UNIFAC{PR{BasicIdeal, PRAlpha, NoTranslation, vdW1fRule}}}} with 2 components:
    "methanol"
    "benzene"
    Contains parameters: a, b, Tc, Pc, Mw

    julia> model.mixing
    HVRule{UNIFAC{PR{BasicIdeal, PRAlpha, NoTranslation, vdW1fRule}}} with 2 components:
    "methanol"
    "benzene"

    julia> model.mixing.activity
    UNIFAC{PR{BasicIdeal, PRAlpha, NoTranslation, vdW1fRule}} with 2 components:
    "methanol": "CH3OH" => 1
    "benzene": "ACH" => 6
    Group Type: UNIFACDortmund
    Contains parameters: A, B, C, R, Q
    ```
Whilst one could combine all the parts listed above in endless ways, there are some default combinations which we provide. These are typically referred to as predictive cubics: Predictive SRK (`PSRK`) and Volume-Translated PR (`VTPR`).

## SAFT Models
Where most models use either single or binary parameters, SAFT models introduce a third type of parameter: association parameters. These can be best seen when building the model:
```julia
julia> model = PCSAFT(["water","1-propanol"])
PCSAFT{BasicIdeal, Float64} with 2 components:
 "water"
 "1-propanol"
Contains parameters: Mw, segment, sigma, epsilon, epsilon_assoc, bondvol

julia> model.sites
SiteParam with 2 components:
 "water": "e" => 1, "H" => 1
 "1-propanol": "e" => 1, "H" => 1

julia> model.params.epsilon_assoc
AssocParam{Float64}["water", "1-propanol"]) with 2 values:
("water", "e") >=< ("water", "H"): 2500.7
("1-propanol", "e") >=< ("1-propanol", "H"): 2276.8
```
When adding association, we allow for interactions between sites on species, hence why the `sites` field has been added. The association parameters are also stored in a slightly different way as well. 

One thing to note is that, unless cross-associating parameters are provided within the database, Clapeyron will not assume any other association interactions. To include these, one can use the `AssocOptions` struct where, as well as other numerical settings, users can specify to use a combining rule:
```julia
julia> model = PCSAFT(["water","1-propanol"];assoc_options=AssocOptions(combining=:esd))
PCSAFT{BasicIdeal, Float64} with 2 components:
 "water"
 "1-propanol"
Contains parameters: Mw, segment, sigma, epsilon, epsilon_assoc, bondvol

julia> model.params.epsilon_assoc
AssocParam{Float64}["water", "1-propanol"]) with 4 values:
("water", "e") >=< ("water", "H"): 2500.7
("1-propanol", "e") >=< ("water", "H"): 2388.75
("1-propanol", "H") >=< ("water", "e"): 2388.75
("1-propanol", "e") >=< ("1-propanol", "H"): 2276.8
```
This may be important when trying to obtain accurate predictions for mixtures.

### Cubic Plus Association
Another class of equation of state that doesn't really fit in either cubics or SAFT equations is CPA, where the two approaches are combined. As a result, the features available in both appraoches are extended to CPA:
```julia
julia> model = CPA(["methanol","ethane"])
CPA{BasicIdeal, RK{BasicIdeal, CPAAlpha, NoTranslation, vdW1fRule}} with 2 components:
 "methanol"
 "ethane"
Contains parameters: a, b, c1, Tc, epsilon_assoc, bondvol, Mw

julia> model = CPA(["methanol","ethane"];cubicmodel=PR,mixing=HVRule,activity=UNIFAC)
CPA{BasicIdeal, PR{BasicIdeal, CPAAlpha, NoTranslation, HVRule{UNIFAC{PR{BasicIdeal, PRAlpha, NoTranslation, vdW1fRule}}}}} with 2 components:
 "methanol"
 "ethane"
Contains parameters: a, b, c1, Tc, epsilon_assoc, bondvol, Mw
```
Making our CPA implementation one of the most-extensible available.
