# OpenSAFT to-do list

The current plans of OpenSAFT are

* Support more group contribution (GC) models like SAFT-Î³ SW and GC versions of PC-SAFT and CK-SAFT.
* Support for more ideal terms (NASA, Wilhoit, etc).
* Support for flash calculations, first using Ratchford-Rice, and eventually HELD.
* Implement framework for physical units.
* Support extensions of the SAFT model (e.g. electrolyte methods and dipole terms).
* Code optimisation by introducing more macros, and changing all string keys to more efficient symbols.
