  abstractnote = {Determination of the global optimum of complex non-convex optimization problems of the real-world applications has remained a challenging task. Many researchers have been developing various types of effective direct search-based methods to tackle these problems. In this paper, we introduce a new variant of the recently developed Spherical Search (SS) algorithm, which contains a powerful and effective self-adaptation structure to enhance the performance. To analyze the performance, proposed algorithm is tested on the 57 test problems collected from different real-world applications. The obtained results statistically confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},
