    AssocOptions(;rtol = 1e-12,atol = 1e-12,max_iters = 1000,dampingfactor = 0.5,combining =:nocombining,dense = true)
Struct containing iteration parameters for the solver of association sites.
the combining option controls the type of combining rule applied to the association strength:
- `nocombining` (default). Does not perform any combination rules.
- `:cr1`: "combining rule - 1":
    ```
    ε[i,j][a,b] = (ε[i,i][a,b] + ε[j,j][a,b])/2
    β[i,j][a,b] = √(β[i,i][a,b] * β[j,j][a,b])
    ```
- `:esd`,`:elliott`: Elliott–Suresh–Donohue combining rule:
    ```
    ε[i,j][a,b] = (ε[i,i][a,b] + ε[j,j][a,b])/2
    β[i,j][a,b] = √(β[i,i][a,b] * β[j,j][a,b]) * (σ[i]*σ[j]/σ[i,j])^3
    ```
- `:esd_runtime`,`:elliott_runtime`: combining rule, performed at runtime. Dense matrix only. slowest, but it is the only way to handle temperature-dependent σ:
    ```
    Δ[i,j][a,b] = (ε[i,i][a,b] + ε[j,j][a,b])/2
    Δ[i,j][a,b] = √(Δ[i,i][a,b] * Δ[j,j][a,b]) 
    ```
!!! info "Association Scheme matters"
    all combining rules implicitly requires that both `Δ(i,i,a,b)` and  `Δ(j,j,a,b)` are non-zero, that means that components that don't self associate will not be combined.
