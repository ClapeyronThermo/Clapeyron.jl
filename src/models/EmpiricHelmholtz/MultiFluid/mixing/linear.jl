## Input parameters
none

## Description
Linear mixing rule for MultiParameter EoS models:

```
τ = T̄/T
δ = V̄/V
V̄ = ∑xᵢVcⱼ
T̄ = ∑xᵢTcᵢ
```

## Model Construction Examples
```
# Because this model does not have parameters, all those constructors are equivalent:
mixing = LinearMixing()
mixing = LinearMixing("water")
mixing = LinearMixing(["water","carbon dioxide"])
```
