Peng Robinson (1978) equation of state. it uses the following models:
- Translation Model: [`NoTranslation`](@ref)
- Alpha Model: [`PR78Alpha`](@ref)
- Mixing Rule Model: [`vdW1fRule`](@ref)

## Model Construction Examples
```julia
# Using the default database
model = PR78("water") #single input
model = PR78(["water","ethanol"]) #multiple components
model = PR78(["water","ethanol"], idealmodel = ReidIdeal) #modifying ideal model
model = PR78(["water","ethanol"],alpha = Soave2019) #modifying alpha function
model = PR78(["water","ethanol"],translation = RackettTranslation) #modifying translation
model = PR78(["water","ethanol"],mixing = KayRule) #using another mixing rule
model = PR78(["water","ethanol"],mixing = WSRule, activity = NRTL) #using advanced EoS+gá´± mixing rule

# Passing a prebuilt model

my_alpha = PRAlpha(["ethane","butane"],userlocations = Dict(:acentricfactor => [0.1,0.2]))
model =  PR78(["ethane","butane"],alpha = my_alpha) #this model becomes a normal PR EoS

# User-provided parameters, passing files or folders
model = PR78(["neon","hydrogen"]; userlocations = ["path/to/my/db","cubic/my_k_values.csv"])

# User-provided parameters, passing parameters directly

model = PR78(["neon","hydrogen"];
        userlocations = (;Tc = [44.492,33.19],
                        Pc = [2679000, 1296400],
                        Mw = [20.17, 2.],
                        acentricfactor = [-0.03,-0.21]
                        k = [0. 0.18; 0.18 0.], #k,l can be ommited in single-component models.
                        l = [0. 0.01; 0.01 0.])
                    )
